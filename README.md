# pancake-bounds

DNA usually evolves by tiny mutations. However, sometimes something more radical happens, and the order of a contiguous segment of genome is rearranged. Understanding these rearrangement sheds light on the process of evolution. Every genome rearrangement results in a change of gene ordering, and a
series of these rearrangements can alter the genomic architecture of a species. Biologists are interested in the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario,
that is, the scenario involving the smallest number of reversals. While there is
no guarantee that this scenario represents an actual evolutionary sequence, it
gives us a lower bound on the number of rearrangements that have occurred
and indicates the similarity between two species.


In this report, I examined a related paper, "Bounds for Pancakes", which offered new bounds for pancake problem in 1979. It is interesting to know that this is the only academic paper by Bill Gates.
