\section{Conclusion}
In this report, we introduced genome rearrangement and two relevant combinatorial problems, MIN-SBPR and MIN-SBR. We then examined bounds for MIN-SBPR. It is worth noting that in 2008, the upper bound was improved, thirty years later, to $\frac{18}{11}$ by a team of researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas, led by Founders Professor Hal Sudborough\cite{new_bounds}.
